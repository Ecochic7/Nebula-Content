// Declare a variable and assign it to a numeric value
// Double that value and re-assign it to the previous variable

const num1 = 5 
console.log(num1 + 5)

// Create two numbers, assign them to variables and add them together
 
num2 = 7
num3 = 5

console.log (num2 + num3)

// Create three numbers, assign them to variables and subtract the smaller two from the largest
num4 = 2
num5 = 8
num6 = 3

const result = num5 - (num4 + num6)
console.log(result)


// Create two even numbers, assign them to variables and divide one from the other
num7 = 10
num8 = 6

const result1 = num7 / num8
console.log(result)


// Create two odd numbers, assign them to variables and multiply one from the other

num9= 7

const result2 = num9 * num10

// Create a variable and log it's remainder, if divided by 3, to the console 

const num11 = 7 % 3

// Answer in plain text, what is modulo especially useful for?
//when we divide by 2 we can figure out if it's an even or odd number.
//% 2
//10 %  2 // even number 
//remainder is 0 -> Even
//remainder is 1 -> ODD
